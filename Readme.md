Wingpower
----------

A pegasus team management sim.
You have two weeks to train all of the pegasai to be the best they can be. At the end of a two-week period, the full roster will attempt to create and maintain a hurricane for the hurricane challenge. 
In the hurricane challenge, the team will have 20 minutes to maintain a hurricane of 800+ cumulative wingpower for at least 2 minutes. The hurricane forms at 200wp

The faster the hurricane, the more control is necesssary to keep it well formed. A poorly formed hurricane will more rapidly drain a pegasus's stamina.

Traits/Abilities:
Dash has pretty much unending stamina and high speed, but probably low control stat, so she wouldn't be able to do much in terms of stopping the hurricane from going out of control. 

Shy would probably have low stats overall but get a brief jump to just under Dash's stats when she's desprate. (I guess running low on stamina but over some threshold of willpower for some reason.) 
DD would probably have overall above average stats, maybe a bit low on the control scale, but has an occasional chance of becoming actively detrimental. (negative control, I guess?)
